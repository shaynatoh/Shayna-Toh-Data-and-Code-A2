# PyHouse: Coding House Music
> This project consists of four songs based on House music. Each song is based on a different feeling (Happy, Chill, Sad, Angry) and is coded into a prompt that can be entered into Python. When the prompt word (e.g. 'happy' or 'chill') is entered into Python, the corresponding song will be played.

## General Information
PyHouse was created to solve the artistic challenge of creating music through Python code. The purpose of this project was to learn how to code whilst challenging my creative skill in making music. I chose to do this project as I always enjoy listening to music and creating it seemed like a fun task to undertake.



## Technologies Used
- TunePad: https://tunepad.com/
- Python
- IDLE
- PIP
- Pygame

2. Chill House: https://tunepad.com/project/89659
3. Sad House: https://tunepad.com/project/89661
4. Angry House: https://tunepad.com/project/90501


## TunePad Files
- Happy House (happy.mp3)
- Angry House (angry.mp3)
- Chill House (chill.mp3)
- Sad House (sad.mp3)



## Setup
1. IDLE must be downloaded onto computer. You can find it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. PIP and Pygame must also be installed into python for the code to run.
   To download pygame, open 'Command Prompt' on computer.
   Then, enter 'pip install pygame'
   Pygame is now installed!
4. Download mp3 files and Pyhouse files into one location.


## Creating the Question Through Code
1. To begin, the user must open IDLE.
2. Import pip and pygame onto IDLE. This can be done by typing:
   'import pip'
   'pip.main(['install', 'pygame'])
   'import pygame'
   Example:

3. Initialise the pygame software. This can be done by typing: 'pygame.init()
   Example:
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5f0d862-c063-4d23-b756-c61216fe1f0e)
4. To ensure that the 'while' variable runs, user must first write 'check = True'. As long as 'check = True', the loop will continue to execute.
   Example:
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd12b090-17d9-4d09-a288-3682fe0ea80a)
5. Now, the user can associate a function with its corresponding song emotion. This can be done by typing:
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ad4ede1-4ce7-48d8-a7eb-2eb10543a620)

## Running the PyHouse File
If the user chooses the user the Pyhouse file download instead of creating its code, they can open the software and respond with the four stated emotions. The corresponding mp3 file will then be played. (Note: the mp3 files must be in the same file location as the Pyhouse file)
