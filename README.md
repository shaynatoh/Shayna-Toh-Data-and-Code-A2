# PyHouse: Coding House Music
> This project consists of four songs based on House music. Each song is based on a different feeling (Happy, Chill, Sad, Angry) and is coded into a prompt that can be entered into Python. When the prompt word (e.g. 'happy' or 'chill') is entered into Python, the corresponding song will be played.

## General Information
PyHouse was created to solve the artistic challenge of creating music through Python code. The purpose of this project was to learn how to code whilst challenging my creative skill in making music. I chose to do this project as I always enjoy listening to music and creating it seemed like a fun task to undertake.
